# Causal_Impact_Share_Price

- The project is focused on analyzing the causal impact of Samsung Electronics' event (CEO's death) on the company's share price using the Bayesian Structured Time Series method
- After retrieving stock price of Samsung Electronics and other companies with high correlation using Yahoo Finance library, I have compared theoretical share price and actual price
- It turned out that the event clearly gave an impact to how people behave in the stock market, with 95% significance level
- Utilized several Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels and CausalImpact, which has been deployed by Google
